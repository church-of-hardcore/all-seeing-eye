## Church of Hardcore
### A World of Warcraft Verification and Logging Addon

This addon provides data integration with the **Hardhead** website (coming soon).

#### In:
 - `/ase` and `/allseeingeye` base slash commands,
 - "All-Seeing Eye" config/options area, with sample widgets
 - Character Profile support via Ace3 (see Interface Options -> AddOns -> All-Seeing Eye -> Profiles) 
 - Mini-map Icon,
 - Tool-tip for enabled/disabled
 - Open Interace Options -> AddOns -> All-Seeing Eye with RMB on Mini-map Icon
 - Open Main GUI Window with LMB on Mini-map Icon (treat as RMB until GUI is ready)
 - Add colour support for simplifying UI

#### Next:
 - Port the 'String Exporter' dialog you wrote for Hardcore to All-Seeing Eye
 - Create custom Layout for StringExporter to include simple verifiable difference
 - Customise Layout further, adding header image, appropriate positioning and perfect re-size behaviour
